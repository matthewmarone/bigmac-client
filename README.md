# bigmactest
Created for Mr. Casey Stein, who presumably loves cheeseburgers.

What follows is our “Big Mac” test.  The project you create for this should have both a server and a client component.  Ideally this will be done use Node and React.  I would prefer that however you do this, when you give me the code, I can just run “npm start” or “yarn start" to spin it up and see the results in action.  I’m going to be looking at code style, quality, unit tests, etc.

Use the free API "IP Vigilante" to resolve the user's IP address to a country
- Docs: https://www.ipvigilante.com/api-developer-docs/

Lookup the country of the user in the this dataset: https://github.com/zelima/big-mac-index/blob/master/data/big-mac-index.csv
- I would take the data from that CSV and cache it somehow instead of loading the CSV on each page load.

Pick another country off that same list A) At random and B) other than the country of the user

UI: Values in brackets need to be generated by code
---------------------------
Top 1/3 of page
You are in [COUNTRY]
Please enter an amount of money in your local currency - [Input Field]
---------------------------------
Middle 1/3 of page - local results
You could buy [#] of Big Macs in your country
Your Dollar Purchasing Parity (PPP) is [#]
This is a simple lookup to the table
----------------------------------
Bottom 1/3 of page - Results compared to random country
Random Country: [RANDOM COUNTRY]
You could buy [#] of Big Macs in [RAND COUNTRY] with [INPUT]!
(calculation is (INPUT / local price) * (local dollar price / RAND COUNTRY dollar price)
Your [INPUT] is worth about [#] in [RAND COUNTRY]
(Calculation is [INPUT] * (local dollar price / RAND COUNTRY dollar price))
-----------------------------------

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
